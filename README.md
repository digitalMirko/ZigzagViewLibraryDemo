Android ZigzagView Library Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'ZigzagView Library Demo App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('ZigzagView Library Demo') on the top. 
Then in the body the ZigzagView is shown. In this app i've shown a variety of different lengths and colors using
the ZigzagView library (<a href="https://github.com/beigirad/ZigzagView">found on github</a>). This effect can be used for
various things such as tickets, photos, invoices, postcards, etc. 

Note the color, height and number of Zigzags can be customized for the user.
